# E-commerce Back End Application

## Description
This application powers the backend of an online store. It uses a mySQL database to store information about products, categories, and tags. The database allows us to add, remove, and manage these items. We have a video demonstrating how we interact with the database using Insomnia, a tool for testing APIs, and how the routes in our application handle requests. You'll find the video included in our submission.

### Installation
[Run] >npm install to ensure all required packages are available. 
[Run] >node server.js to start the application. 
Use Insomnia to test the routes. This including get, post, put, and delete requests.
The server.js file initializes and seeds the database, then starts the server on port 3001.

### Video Tutorial
Video tutorial can be found in the "assets" folder. The video tutorial only shows the category routes. The other routes have the same functionality but I felt it redundant to show those as well.
